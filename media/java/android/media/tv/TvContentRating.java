/**
 * A class representing a TV content rating. When a TV input service inserts the content rating
 * information on a program into the database, this class can be used to generate the formatted
 * string for
 * {@link TvContract.Programs#COLUMN_CONTENT_RATING TvContract.Programs.COLUMN_CONTENT_RATING}.
 * To create a {@code TvContentRating} object, use the
 * {@link #createRating TvContentRating.createRating} method with valid rating system string
 * constants.
 * <p>
 * It is possible for an application to define its own content rating system by supplying a content
 * rating system definition XML resource (see example below) and declaring a broadcast receiver that
 * filters {@link TvInputManager#ACTION_QUERY_CONTENT_RATING_SYSTEMS} in its manifest.
 * </p>
 * <h3> Example: Rating system definition for the TV Parental Guidelines</h3>
 * The following XML example shows how the TV Parental Guidelines in the United States can be

 * <p>For example, to create an object that represents TV-PG rating with suggestive dialogue and

 * code snippet:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * TvContentRating rating = TvContentRating.createRating(
 *         "com.android.tv",
 *         "US_TV",
