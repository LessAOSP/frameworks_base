 * A class representing a TV content rating.
 * When a TV input service provides the content rating information of a program into TV provider,
 * TvContentRating class will be used for generating the value of {@link
 * TvContract.Programs#COLUMN_CONTENT_RATING}. To create an object of {@link TvContentRating}, use
 * the {@link #createRating} method with valid arguments. The arguments could be a system defined
 * strings, or a TV input service defined strings.
 * TV input service defined strings are in an xml file defined in <code>&lt;{@link
 * android.R.styleable#TvInputService tv-input}&gt;</code> with the {@link
 * android.R.attr#contentRatingSystemXml contentRatingSystemXml} attribute by the TV input service.
