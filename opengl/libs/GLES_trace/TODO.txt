TODO:
    - Context - Currently, we don't do anything regarding the contexts that are created.
    Need to maintain more state regarding contexts, and figure out what happens in the
    presence of multiple contexts.

    - Transport: Each GLMessage is sent via a socket as soon as the message is received.
    i.e., there is no buffering of messages. Buffering should improve performance.

    - Initialization: On first connection, send some basic information that includes:
        1. version of the trace library
        2. implementation dependent GL state variables such as # of vertex arrays etc.

    - eglSwapBuffers: The images are lzf compressed, but there is no mode that transfers
    only the differences from the previous images.
