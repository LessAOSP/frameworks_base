The licence is not included in the compiled code to minimize the size
of JavaScript injected into web pages.

Those files can be generated by doing the following:
$svn checkout http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ .
$./go //javascript/webdriver-atoms/inject:<js_fragment_name>:android

Where <js_fragment_name> should be replaced by the actual name of the fragment to
generate. For example to generate is_selected_android.js, execute:
$./go //javascript/webdriver-atoms/inject:is_selected:android

The build file for those rules is under the following:
http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/webdriver-atoms/inject/build.desc
Every js_fragment rule generates a JavaScript file containing the corresponding
JavaScript code snippet.

The current version of the files was generated using revision 11823.

Here is the build command list executed to generate those files:
./go //javascript/webdriver-atoms/inject:find_element:android
./go //javascript/webdriver-atoms/inject:find_elements:android
