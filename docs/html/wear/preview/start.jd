<p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong>
The current Android Wear Developer Preview is intended for <b>development and testing purposes only</b>, not for production apps. Google may change this Developer Preview significantly prior to the official release of the Android Wear SDK. You may not publicly distribute or ship any application using this Developer Preview, as this Developer Preview will no longer be supported after the official SDK is released (which will cause applications based only on the Developer Preview to break).</p>

<p>The Android Wear emulator now starts. To begin testing your app's notifications,
you must now pair the emulator to your development device
that has the <em>Android Wear Preview</em> app installed.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Tip:</strong> To improve the emulator startup time, edit your AVD
and enable <strong>Snapshot</strong> under Emulator Options. When you start the emulator,
select <strong>Save to snapshot</strong> then click <strong>Launch</strong>. Once the emulator
is running, close it to save a snapshot of the system.
Start the AVD again, but select <strong>Launch from snapshot</strong> and
deselect <strong>Save to snapshot</strong>.</p>

<p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong> Do not install apps on the Android Wear emulator.
The system does not support traditional Android apps and the result of running such apps is
unpredictable.</p>



<h2 id="SetupApp">3. Set Up the Android Wear Preview App</h2>

<p>To view your app's notifications on the Android Wear emulator, you must have the
<em>Android Wear Preview</em> app installed on your Android device (a phone or tablet).</p>

<p>To receive the Android Wear Preview app, you must <a
href="{@docRoot}wear/preview/signup.html">sign up for the Developer Preview</a> using the same
Gmail or Google account you use with Google Play Store.</p>
</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>Android Wear Preview</em> app is compatible with
    Android 4.3 and higher and is not available for the Android emulator.</p>

<p>After you've signed up for the Developer Preview,
  you'll receive a confirmation email that includes a link to opt-in to the
  <em>Android Wear Preview</em> app beta program. Once you opt-in, it may take up to 24 hours for the
  app to become available in Google Play Store.</p>

<p>After you install the <em>Android Wear Preview</em> app, you can set up
  your device to communicate with the Android Wear emulator:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the <em>Android Wear Preview</em> app. You should see a notice that the app is currently
  not enabled as a notification listener. Tap the message to open the system settings,
  then select Android Wear Preview to grant it notification access.</li>
<li>Connect your device to your development machine over USB. Be sure that no other
 Android devices are connected to the machine.</li>
<li>Ensure that the Android Wear emulator (created in the previous section) is running.
The emulator should show the time and an icon that indicates no device is connected.</li>
<li>Open a command line terminal, navigate to your Android SDK's <code>platform-tools/</code>
directory, then execute:
<pre style="margin-top:.5em">adb -d forward tcp:5601 tcp:5601</pre>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You must execute this command each time you connect your
device over USB.</p>
</li>
<li>Return to the Android Wear Preview app. It should now indicate that it is connected to
  the emulator. The Android Wear emulator should now show the 'g' orb icon, indicating
  that is is connected to your device.
</ol>

<p>Now, notifications from your device also appear in the Android Wear emulator.</p>




<h2 id="AddLibrary">4. Add the Support Library to Your Project</h2>

<p>The Android Wear preview support library includes several APIs that allow you to
optimize your app's notifications for the Android Wear user experience.</p>

<p>To receive the preview support library, you must <a
href="{@docRoot}wear/preview/signup.html">sign up for the Developer Preview</a>. The
confirmation email you receive after you sign up includes a link to download a ZIP file,
which contains the preview support library and some sample apps.</p>

<p>After you download and unzip the package, add the preview support library
sto your Android project:</p>

<p><b>If you're using Eclipse:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>In your Android app project, create a <code>libs/</code> directory in your project root
    (the same location as the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file).</li>
      <li>Copy the v4 support library JAR file from your Android SDK directory (e.g.,
        <code>&lt;sdk&gt;/extras/android/support/v4/android-support-v4.jar</code>) into your
        project <code>libs/</code> directory.
      <li>Also save the <code>wearable-preview-support.jar</code> file in the <code>libs/</code> directory.
      <li>Right click each JAR file and select <strong>Build Path &gt; Add to Build Path</strong>.</li>
    </ol>

 <p><b>If you're using Android Studio:</b></p>
    <ol>
     <li>In your Android app project, create a <code>libs/</code> directory in your project root
    (the same location as the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file).</li>
      <li>Save the <code>wearable-preview-support.jar</code> file in the <code>libs/</code> directory.
      <li>Open the <code>build.gradle</code> file in your app module.</li>
      <li>Add a dependency rule for both the v4 support library and the Android Wear
      preview support library:
<pre>
dependencies {
    compile "com.android.support:support-v4:18.0.+"
    compile files('../libs/wearable-preview-support.jar')
}
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Sync Project with Gradle Files</strong> in the toolbar.</li>
    </ol>
