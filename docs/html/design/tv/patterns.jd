<p>As a developer of apps for TV, you should follow certain patterns to enable users to
  quickly understand and efficiently your app. This section describes recommended design patterns
  for TV apps.</p>

<h2>Navigation</h2>

<p>Users typically navigate TV devices using a directional pad (D-Pad). This type of controller
  limits movement to up, down, left, and right. In a typical D-Pad remote, hardware keys that
  correspond to those directions are present and an additional action key is available to make a
  selection. As you design your Android application for TVs, pay special attention to how users
  navigate your application when using a remote control instead of a touchscreen.</p>

<p>[add visual: D-Pad image or illustration]</p>

<p>A key aspect of making your application work well with a D-Pad controller is to make sure
  that there is always a object that is obviously in focus. If a user cannot see what is in focus,
  they will not be able to navigate your app intuitively with this type of controller.</p>

<p>Optimize your app screen layouts for D-Pad navigation. Align objects in your app lists and
  grids to make navigation within each screen intuitive. Design your layout so it takes advantage of
  two-axis navigation.</p>


<h2>Home and Back Buttons</h2>

<p>
  In addition to the D-Pad buttons, Android TV devices always include Home and Back buttons on their
  controllers. Make sure the Back button functions within your app in a way that is consistent with
  the general <a href="{@docRoot}design/patterns/navigation.html">Android Design guidelines</a>.
</p>


<h2>Focus and Selection</h2>

<p>Providing good focus and selection indicators is key to making your app useable on TV. As
  mentioned previously, making sure that an object is always selected in your app is critical for
  effective navigation using a D-Pad. This requirement also means that you must use focus indicators
  that are easy to recognize and should be consistent throughout your app.</p>

</p>

<p>The default focus indicator used in Android TV use a combination of scale, shadow,
  brightness, and opacity. The focus feedback is enhanced by displaying an animation going from a
  non-focused to a focused state and back. Instead of immediately applying the focus transformation,
  it is animated into place to reduce abrupt changes and help users notice how the object changed.</p>

<h2>Audio Feedback</h2>

<p>Sounds on Android TV bring a cinematic quality to the interaction experience. You should
  consider adding sounds for user actions or to provide feedback when a user is only partially
  visually engaged with the screen (e.g., because they have their hands full or are multitasking).
  You should also consider using sounds as alternatives to error messages, for example to indicate
  that a user has reached the end of a list or is trying to navigate to an undefined location.</p>

<h2>Banners</h2>

<p>
  App Banners represent your app on the home screen of TV devices and serves and as a way for
  users to launch your app. Here are specific requirements for the banner image:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Size: 320 x 180 px, xhdpi resource</li>
  <li>Text should be included in the image. If your app is available in more than one
      language, you must provide version of the banner image for each supported language.</li>
</ul>


<h2>App Icons</h2>

<p>The app icon is shown in recommendation cards on the Home screen, search results and the main
  Browse screen of your app if you use {@code BrowseFragment}. Here are the specific
  requirements for the app icon:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Full color: size: 52x52dp, PNG</p></li>
  <li><p>Monocolor: size 52x52dp, white(#fff) icon with transparent background, PNG</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Background Images</h2>

<p>Background images are displayed in the background of your app to provide additional visual
  interest, information or branding. The BrowseFragment and DetailsFragment classes in the Leanback
  support library provide specific support for background images and updating them as items are
  brought into and out of focus. Here are the specific requirements for background images:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2016x1134 (1920x1080 + 5% extra margin for motion)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> If the image does not meet this requirement, it is scaled to fit.
