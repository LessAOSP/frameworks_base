<p>Follow these style guidelines to create beautiful, functional apps for TV.</p>


<h2>Layouts</h2>

<p>The difference between a TV experience that feels right and one that does not greatly depends
  on the number, spacing and size of on-screen elements. Although TV sizes and resolutions have
  steadily increased over time, users expect TV experiences to be relatively simple and
  uncluttered.</p>

<p>The additional resolution and screen area afforded by modern displays is best used to display
  things at better quality, rather than greater quantity. For example, use your layouts to show
  large, beautiful pieces of content, or resize type for both easy reading and generous spacing.</p>

<p>If you are creating an app for browsing and playing content, use the prebuilt fragments in the
  Leanback support library. These layouts have been built specifically for use on TV devices with
  the guidance of the Android User Experience team. For more information on using these classes,
  see the <a href="{@docRoot}preview/tv/build-ui/index.html">User Interfaces</a> guide.
</p>

<p>Here are some additional recommendations for creating functional and attractive layout for TV
  apps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Build layouts designed for landscape orientation. TV screens always use in this
      orientation.</p></li>
  <li><p>Put on-screen navigational controls on the left or right side of the screen and
      save the vertical space for content.</p></li>
  <li><p>Create UIs that are divided into sections, by using Fragments and use view groups
      like GridView instead of ListView to make better use of the horizontal screen space.</p></li>
  <li><p>Add sufficient margins between layout controls to avoid a cluttered interface.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Screen Size</h3>

<p>TV devices running Android are intended to operate at HD resolution (1920 x 1080 pixels) or
  higher. Design your artwork assets for best viewing at this resolution.</p>


<h3>Overscan</h3>

<p>During the evolution of TV technology, overscan originally described an area of TV content
  outside of a safe zone that most TVs could reliably display. Even on some of todayâ€™s HDTV flat
  screens, areas outside that zone may not be visible.</p>

<p>Build a 10% margin into your TV screen designs to account for overscan area the TV may not
  display correctly. On a 1920 x 1080 pixel screen, this margin should be a minimum of 27px from the
  top and bottom edges and a minimum of 48px from the right and left edges of the picture.</p>


<h2>Color</h2>

<p>Color rendering on televisions can be imprecise compared to computer monitors or mobile
  devices. LCD and Plasma TVs often apply smoothing and sharpening filters, and color rendering may
  not match what you see on a computer screen.</p>

<p>Subtle hue or brightness differences between elements may disappear or be over-emphasized on
  TV screens. Some color gradient combinations will show bands. You should avoid pure whites and
  highly saturated colors in large areas of the screen (especially reds, greens and blues). You
  should also avoid using very dark or muddy colors, as TV settings may display these colors with
  exaggerated contrast, causing them to be indistinguishable.</p>


<h2>Typography</h2>

<p>The text and controls in a TV application's UI should be easily visible and navigable from a
  distance. The minimum recommended font size for TV is 12sp. The default text size setting should
  be 18sp. We recommend the following guidelines for TV apps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Browse Titles: Regular 44sp</li>
  <li>Browse Menu Category Text: 20sp at 50% transparency</li>
  <li>Browse Focused Menu Category Text: 24sp with no transparency</li>
  <li>Row Category Titles focused: 20sp with no transparency</li>
  <li>Row Category Titles focused: 20sp at 50% transparency</li>
  <li>Details Content Titles: 34sp</li>
  <li>Details Subtext: 14sp</li>
</ul>

<p>[visual showing text on a TV screen (sidebar position)]</p>

<p>Some TVs have strong sharpness and contrast settings as their defaults. These picture
  settings make thin and light typefaces look jagged and make the text difficult for people to read.
  Therefore you should avoid thin or light typefaces on TV.</p>

<h2>Text</h2>

<p>Use text in TV apps sparingly. The position of users relative to a TV screen
  (typically about 10 away) makes it harder for users to read text and the expectation of users in a
  TV environment not conducive to reading. Follow these tips for the best handling of text in your
  app:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Break text into small chunks that users can quickly scan.</li>
  <li>Use light text on a dark background. This style is easier to read on a TV.</li>
  <li>Avoid lightweight fonts or fonts that have both very narrow and very broad
      strokes. Use simple sans-serif fonts and use anti-aliasing to increase readability.</li>
  <li>Use layout-relative sizing rather than absolute sizing and density-independent
      pixel units instead of absolute pixel units.</li>
</ul>
