<p>Use the features of Google Search for Android to drive the use of your apps: </p>

<ul>
<li>Once users have installed your app, search can bring them back with <strong>deep-links</strong> direct to your app. </li>
  <li>When users use <strong>voice commands</strong> to ask Google to perform a task, your app can be one of those
completing the task.</li>

<li>You can also take advantage of <strong>Google Now</strong> to
display cards for event, flight, hotel, and restaurant reservations you notify
to users’ gmail addresses, and bring users back from the email linked to the
card.</li>
</ul>
