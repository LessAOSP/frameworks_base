<p>
  If you got great apps targeting kids and/or families, the family-focused experience
  on Google Play is a great way to make them discoverable by parents.
</p>

<p>Developers are invited to opt-in these apps and games to the new Designed for
  Families program. Apps that meet the <a href=
  "https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6184502">program
  requirements</a> will be shown in the new family experience so that
  parents can find suitable, trusted, high-quality apps and games more easily.
</p>

<p>
  Opt-in your apps and games today using the tools and processes you currently
  use to manage your apps in the Developer Console. Your apps in the program
  can benefit from enhanced discoverability in addition to maintaining their
  existing categories, rankings, and reviews elsewhere on the Google Play
  store.
</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>
  By opting-in to Designed for Families, parents can easily find your family-friendly
  content on the Google Play store however they are accessing it.
</p>

<h3>Search</h3> 

<p>
  Only content opted-in to the Designed for Families program will show up in search results
  from any of the family sections. This is a huge boost to this content as a majority of
  searches on the Play Store containing the terms “apps for” or “games for” are related to
  kids.
</p>

<h3>Browse</h3>

<p>
  Family sections within Apps, Games, Movies & TV and Music provide enhanced discovery for
  parents. These sections act as true home pages and contain unique categories tailored to kids
  content, specific age-based categories, and merchandised content.
</p>

<h3>Character pages</h3>

<p>
  All content for particular popular characters can now be found in one place on character pages,
  including apps, games, movies, tv, and books. It’s a powerful way to promote children’s brands
  across content, and allows you to reach a highly relevant and targeted audience. Character
  pages are also a way to alleviate concerns around IP protection, since only properly licensed
  content is on these pages. 
</p>

<h3>Merchandising</h3>

<p>
  The family sections have their own merchandised content, with new opportunities for featuring
  on the home pages of the family sections and and within the age-specific home pages. The pages
  are curated to ensure quality and limited to only content opted-in to Designed for Families
  and appropriate for specific age ranges.
</p>

<h3>Badging</h3>

<p>
  Apps opted-in to Designed for Families will receive family-friendly badges, which are a marker
  of quality and signal to parents that apps are suitable for users of specific ages groups.
  Clicking on a badge also leads you to other apps and games with that badge. 
</p>

<h2 id="elibibility">Eligibility</h2>

<p>
  Apps in the family-friendly experience on Google Play are more
  discoverable by parents and families, who expect the apps to appeal to kids under 13 and be age
  appropriate. The Designed for Families program is designed to be inclusive of
  apps that are made for kids as well as those that can be enjoyed by the
  entire family. To address this audience, there are specific guidelines and
  policies your apps need to meet, which will be assessed in an app content
  review.
</p>

<p>
  Make sure that you're familiar with the policies that your app must comply
  with. These include <a href=
  "http://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html">content
  policies</a>, the <a href=
  "http://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html">Developer
  Distribution Agreement</a>, and the <a href=
  "https://play.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/families/developer-distribution-agreement-addendum.html">
  Designed for Families DDA Addendum</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Your app must also meet the <a href=
  "https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6184502">Designed
  for Families program requirements</a> listed in the Google Play Developer
  Help Center.
