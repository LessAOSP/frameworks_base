page.title=Migrating from Eclipse

@jd:body


<p>If you've previously developed for Android using Eclipse and would like to migrate
to Android Studio, you should export your projects from Eclipse in order to generate
Gradle build files. You can then import your project into Android Studio.</p>


<h2 id="Export">Export from Eclipse</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/adt.html#Updating">Update your Eclipse ADT Plugin</a>
  (you must have version 22.0 or higher).</li>
<li>In Eclipse, select <strong>File > Export</strong>.</li>
<li>In the window that appears, open <strong>Android</strong> and select <strong>Generate Gradle
build files</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the projects you want to export for Android Studio and click
<strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your selected projects remain in the same location but now contain a {@code .gradle}
build file and are ready for Android Studio.</p>


<h2 id="Export">Import into Android Studio</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In Android Studio, select <strong>File > Import Project</strong>.</li>
  <li>Locate a project you exported from Eclipse, select the project's root directory and
    click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Create project from existing sources</strong> and click
    <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
  <li>Follow the walk-through to complete the import process.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now that your projects are imported to Android Studio, 
read <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/installing/studio-tips.html">Tips and Tricks</a> for some
help getting started.</p>


<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
It's possible to import an existing Android project to Android Studio even if you
don't generate a Gradle build file from Eclipse&mdash;Android Studio will successfully build and
run projects using an existing Ant build file. However, in order to take advantage of build
variants and other advanced features in the future,
we strongly suggest that you generate a Gradle build file using
the ADT plugin or write your own Gradle build file for use with Android Studio.
For more information about the Gradle build system, see the

Plugin User Guide</a>.</p>
