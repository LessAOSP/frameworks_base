<p>If you're currently using Eclipse with ADT, we recommend you migrate to
<a href="{@docRoot}tools/basics/index.html">Android Studio</a>, a new Android
development environment powered by IntelliJ IDEA. On top of the capabilities you expect from
IntelliJ, Android Studio offers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flexible Gradle-based build system.</li>
  <li>Build variants and multiple APK generation.</li>
  <li>Expanded template support for Google services and various device types.</li>
  <li>Rich layout editor with support for theme editing.</li>
  <li>Lint tools to catch performance, usability, version compatibility, and other problems.</li>
  <li>ProGuard and app-signing capabilities.</li>
  <li>Built-in support for <a
  href="https://developers.google.com/cloud/devtools/android_studio_templates/"
  class="external-link">Google Cloud Platform</a>, making it easy to integrate Google Cloud
  Messaging and App Engine.</li>
  <li>And <a href="{@docRoot}tools/studio/index.html">much more</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="import">Import into Android Studio</h2>

<p>If you've previously developed for Android using Eclipse and would like to migrate
to Android Studio, you can import your project into Android Studio.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In Android Studio, close any projects currently open. You should see the
  <strong>Welcome to Android Studio</strong> window.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Import Project</strong>.</li>
  <li>Locate the project you exported from Eclipse, expand it, select the
  <strong>build.gradle</strong> file and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the following dialog, leave <strong>Use gradle wrapper</strong> selected and click
  <strong>OK</strong>. (You do not need to specify the Gradle home.)</li>

<p>It's possible to import an existing Android project to Android Studio even if you
don't generate a Gradle build file from Eclipse&mdash;Android Studio will successfully build and
run projects using an existing Ant build file.</p>

<p>However, in order to take advantage of build
variants and other advanced features in the future,
we strongly suggest that you generate a Gradle build file using
the ADT plugin or write your own Gradle build file for use with Android Studio.
For more information about the build system, see the
<a href="{@docRoot}sdk/installing/studio-build.html">Build System</a> guide.</p>
