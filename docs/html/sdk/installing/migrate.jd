<p>To quickly start developing apps, we recommend you migrate to Android Studio, a new Android
development environment powered by IntelliJ IDEA. On top of the capabilities you expect from
IntelliJ, Android Studio offers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Flexible Gradle-based build system.</li>
  <li>Build variants and multiple APK generation.</li>
  <li>Expanded template support for Google services and various device types.</li>
  <li>Rich layout editor with support for theme editing.</li>
  <li>Lint tools to catch performance, usability, version compatibility, and other problems.</li>
  <li>ProGuard and app-signing capabilities.</li>
  <li>Built-in support for <a

  class="external-link">Google Cloud Platform</a>, making it easy to integrate Google Cloud
  Messaging and App Engine.</li>
  <li>And much more.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you've previously developed for Android using Eclipse and would like to migrate

to Android Studio, you should export your projects from Eclipse in order to generate
Gradle build files. You can then import your project into Android Studio.</p>

<p>Now that your project is imported to Android Studio,
read <a href="{@docRoot}tools/basics/index.html">Android Studio Basics</a> for some
help getting started.</p>


<p>It's possible to import an existing Android project to Android Studio even if you
don't generate a Gradle build file from Eclipse&mdash;Android Studio will successfully build and
run projects using an existing Ant build file.</p>

<p>However, in order to take advantage of build
variants and other advanced features in the future,
we strongly suggest that you generate a Gradle build file using
the ADT plugin or write your own Gradle build file for use with Android Studio.
For more information about the build system, see the
<a href="{@docRoot}sdk/installing/studio-build.html">Build System Overview</a>.</p>
