<p>The Google Play services app is currently being rolled out to the hundreds of millions of
Android devices and will complete in early July. Because of this, we usually wait to release the Google Play
services SDK until all users receive the app. This guarantees that your newly-updated apps can
run on the most devices as possible.</p>

<p>However, if want to develop for Android Wear now, complete the following steps
to get special access to all the things you need to start developing, without waiting
for the rollout to complete. </p>

<p class="warning"><b>Warning</b>: Do not publish any apps that use the new Google Play services
APIs until the rollout is complete. Your apps will break on most user devices, which will
degrade your user rating.</b>
</p>
