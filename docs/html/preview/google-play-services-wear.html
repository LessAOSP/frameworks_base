<p>Google Play services 5.0  is currently being rolled out to the world.
We usually wait to release the Google Play services SDK until the rollout completes.
This ensures that your newly-updated apps can run on the most devices as possible.</p>

<p>However, if you want to develop for Android Wear now, complete the following steps to get
special access to all the things you need to start developing, without waiting for the rollout to
complete.</p>

<p class="warning"><b>Warning</b>: Do not publish any apps that are built with Google Play services
SDK 5.0 until the rollout is completed over the coming days.  Your apps will break on most user
devices, which will degrade your apps’ user experience. We’ll publish an update to the
<a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/">Android Developer blog</a> when the rollout is done.
</p>
