<p>Google Play services 5.0  is currently being rolled out to the world.
We usually wait to release the Google Play services SDK until the rollout completes.
This ensures that your newly-updated apps can run on the most devices as possible.</p>

<p>However, if you want to develop for Android Wear now, complete the following steps to get
special access to all the things you need to start developing, without waiting for the rollout to
complete.</p>

<p class="warning"><b>Warning</b>: Do not publish any apps that are built with Google Play services
SDK 5.0 until the rollout is completed over the coming days.  Your apps will break on most user
devices, which will degrade your apps’ user experience. We’ll publish an update to the
<a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/">Android Developer blog</a> when the rollout is done.
</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">1. Get Whitelisted for the Preview</h2><hr>

<p>If you attended Google I/O, your registered Google account is automatically whitelisted for
these preview resources. You're done! Head to Step 2.</p>

<p><stong><em>If you didn't attend Google I/O</em></strong> or want to use a different account,
click following link to
<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/io14androidweardev/subscribe" target="_blank">join

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">2. Download Required Apps</h2><hr>
<p>You'll need the following apps to get the most out of Android Wear:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.gms">Google Play services</a>:
Allows your Android Wear device to communicate with your handheld device. This is required to
use the Android Wear app and other apps listed below.</li>
  <li><a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.wearable.app">Android Wear
  Companion</a>: The app for pairing a handheld to a wearable and providing syncing of
  notifications and data
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox">Google

</ol>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">3. Start Building</h2><hr>

<p>The Google Play services SDK is required if you want to sync and send data between wearable
and handheld devices. To get the new SDK that is compatible with the Google Play services
APK that you just installed, follow these steps: </p>

<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> We highly recommend you use Android Studio for Wear development.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start AVD Manager.</li>
  <li>Update the Android SDK Tools and Platform-tools to versions 23 and 20 respectively.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Tools > Manage Add-on Sites > User Defined Sites</b>.</li>
  <li>Click <b>New</b>, enter
  <code>https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/addon-play-services-5.xml</code> into the
  text field, and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
  <li>Click Close. You should now see new emulator images that support this preview
  release of Google Play services and the Google Play services client libraries you need to
  start developing.</li>
</ol>
