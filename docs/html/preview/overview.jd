<p>
  The M Developer Preview program is an opportunity for you to test the compatibility of your apps
  with the next platform release, try out early versions of new API features, and provide feedback
  to the Android team. The program includes update releases during course of the program to allow
  you to follow the progress of feature development and fixes, leading up to the official release
  of the platform, as shown in Figure 1.

<p>
  We strongly encourage you to provide feedback for the M Preview releases through our <a href=
  "https://code.google.com/p/android-developer-preview/">issue tracker</a>. Issues reported early
  in the program have a better chance of being addressed before the official release, so reports
  provided by June 30, 2015 receive priority processing by the Android team.
</p>

<p>
