<p>
  The Android M platform is still under development, but weâ€™re offering developers an early look
  through the Android M Developer Preview program. This program is an opportunity for you to test
  the compatibility of your apps with the next platform release, try out early versions of new API
  features, and provide feedback to the Android team. Developers can try out the M Preview system
  on with the Android SDK emulator or on Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 9, and Nexus Player devices. The
  program includes update releases during course of the program to allow you to follow the progress
  of feature development and fixes, leading up to the official release of the platform.

  Timeline for the M Developer Preview program.
</p>

<p>
  We strongly encourage you to provide feedback for the M Preview releases through our <a href=
  "https://code.google.com/p/android-developer-preview/">issue tracker</a>. Issues reported early
  in the program have a better chance of being addressed before the official release, so reports
  provided by June 30, 2015 receive priority processing by the Android team.
</p>

<p>
  To get started testing your app:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review the <a href="{@docRoot}preview/api-overview.html"> API Overview</a> and
    <a href="{@docRoot}preview/api-changes.html">Behavior Changes</a> to
    get an idea of what's new and how it affects your app.
  </li>

  <li>Setup for testing and development by following the instructions for
    <a href="{@docRoot}preview/setup-sdk.html">Setting up the Preview SDK</a>
    and configuring test devices.
  </li>

  <li>You can <a href="{@docRoot}preview/download.html">download</a> the latest M Developer
    Preview system image for compatible Nexus devices and install it for testing. Once you have
    flashed a development device, it is upgraded automatically with the next preview release
    through over-the-air (OTA) updates.
  </li>

  <li>Review the M Preview <a href="{@docRoot}preview/reference.html">API Reference</a> and
    <a href="{@docRoot}preview/samples.html">samples</a> to
    gain more insight into new API features and how to use them in your app.
  </li>

  <li>Join the M Preview <a href="http://g.co/dev/AndroidMDevPreview">Google+ developer
    community</a> to get the latest developer updates and connect with other
    developers working with the preview.
  </li>
</ul>

  Thanks in advance for your participation in the developer preview program!
