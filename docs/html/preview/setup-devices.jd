<h3>To the Developer Preview</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Download and extract the Android Developer Preview package to a directory
  referred to as <code>&lt;extracted_images&gt;</code>.</li>
  <li>Connect your powered-off Android device to your development machine and
  press and hold the following buttons until your device is in fastboot mode:
    <ul>
    <li>For Nexus 5: vol down + vol up + power</li>
    <li>For Nexus 7: vol down + power </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Alternatively, run <code>adb reboot bootloader</code>
    with USB debugging turned on to enter fastboot mode.
    The device must be booted up if youâ€™re using this method.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Follow the instructions at
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images">developers.google.com/android</a>
  to set up your system for flashing devices.</li>
  <li>Run the <code>&lt;extracted-images&gt;/flash-all</code> script
  corresponding to your platform. This script flashes all of the system data
  onto the phone.</li>
  <li>(Optional) After flashing is complete, run <code>fastboot oem lock</code>
  with the device in fastboot mode to lock it again. This does not wipe your
  device, but if you want to flash again, you need to run <code>fastboot oem
  unlock</code>, which wipes your device. We recommend you leave the
  bootloader unlocked until you are done with flashing the device.</li>
</ol>

<h3>To factory specifications</h3>

  <p>Go to <a href="http://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images">developers.google.com/android</a>
  and download the image you want to flash to for your device.
  Follow the instructions there to flash the image to your device.</p>
