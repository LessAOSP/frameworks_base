@jd:body

<p>The new material design features (like the Material theme and custom animations) are only
available in the Android L Developer Preview. However, you can design your apps to make use of
these features when running on devices with the Android L Developer Preview and still be
compatible with previous releases of Android.</p>


<h2 style="margin-top:35px">Material Theme</h2>

<p>The Material theme is only available in the Android L Developer Preview. To configure your
app to use the Material theme on devices running the Android L Developer Preview and an older
theme on devices running earlier versions of Android:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define a theme that inherits from an older theme (like Holo) in
<code>res/values/styles.xml</code>.</li>
<li>Define a theme with the same name that inherits from the Material theme in
<code>res/values-v21/styles.xml</code>.</li>
<li>Set this theme as your app's theme in the manifest file.</li>
</ol>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you do not provide an alternative theme in this manner,
your app will not run on earlier versions of Android.</p>


<h2 style="margin-top:35px">Layouts</h2>

<p>If the layouts that you design according to the material design guidelines do not use any
of the new XML attributes from the Android L Developer Preview, they will work on previous
versions of Android. Otherwise, you can provide alternative layouts. You can also provide
alternative layouts to customize how your app looks on earlier versions of Android.</p>

<p>Create your layout files for the Android L Developer Preview inside <code>res/layout-v21/</code>
and your alternative layout files for earlier versions of Android inside <code>res/layout/</code>.
Alternative layouts have the same file name.</p>


<h2 style="margin-top:35px">UI Widgets</h2>

<p>The <code>RecyclerView</code> and <code>CardView</code> widgets are included in the Android L
Developer Preview Support Library, so they are available in earlier versions of Android.</p>


<h2 style="margin-top:35px">Animation APIs</h2>

<p>The new APIs for custom animations are only available in the Android L Developer Preview. To
preserve compatibility with earlier verisons of Android, check the system version at runtime before
you invoke these APIs.</p>
